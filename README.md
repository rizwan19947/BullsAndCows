# BullCowGame

This short (game?) is a project that I developed while completing a section of an Unreal Engine Masterclass by Gamedev.tv
The primary focus was C++ programming within the game and dealing with project management issues with regards to Unreal Editor 
The secondary focus was on optimizing the function calls and the overall performance of the program by making sure that minimal memory and processing power was used to execute tasks. And while this may seem very trivial for a project so simple and small as this, it served as a good foundation to lay the foundation for these basics.
